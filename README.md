# AI_AGENT Project

**Overview**
AI_AGENT is a simple AI-based web testing agent built using **Flask** and **LangGraph**.  
In **Milestone 1**, we set up the development environment, created a basic web server using Flask, and built a basic LangGraph agent that can receive and respond to user inputs.

## Milestone 1: Week 1–2

**Goal:**  
Set up everything needed to start building the AI testing agent.

**What We Did:**
- Installed Python and necessary libraries:
  - Flask (for the web server)
  - LangGraph (for building the AI agent)
  - Playwright (for browser automation later)
- Created a clear folder structure for the project
- Started a basic Flask server to show a simple HTML page (`index.html`)
- Built a simple LangGraph agent that can take input and echo it back

**What We Achieved:**
- Python environment is ready for coding
- Flask server is running locally at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`  
  (Open this URL in your browser after running `python run.py`)
- Baseline agent can receive inputs and give responses
