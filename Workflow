Title: AI Agent to Test Websites Automatically Using Natural Language
Milestone Number: 1(Week 1-2)
Objective:
The objective of this milestone is to build a structured foundation for an AI-based testing agent by setting up a clean development environment, initializing a Flask backend, and implementing a baseline LangGraph agent capable of handling user inputs, with scalability for future AI-driven testing workflows.
Things that are performed:
1.Setting up Python environment and Installing Dependencies:
The steps performed are:
  i)	Created a Python virtual environment inside the project directory to isolate dependencies: python -m venv .venv
  ii)	Activated the virtual environment: .venv\Scripts\activate
  iii)	Installed required dependencies: pip install flask langgraph playwright
  iv)	Verified LangGraph installation: pip show langgraph


2. Defining Project Structure and Initializing Flask Server
Designed a clean, modular project structure and initialize a Flask server capable of serving a static HTML test page.
 
Flask Server Setup was done by:
  i)	Implementing Flask app in server.py to serve static content.
  ii)	Configured the root route (/) to return index.html from the static folder.
  iii)	Used run.py as the application entry point.
  iv)   Started the Flask server using: python run.py
  v)	Verified that the static HTML page loads correctly at http://127.0.0.1:5000. 

 

3. Implementing Baseline LangGraph Agent Configuration
Here, implementation of a minimal yet functional LangGraph agent capable of handling user input and producing structured output has been done.

Agent Design and LangGraph Workflow
   i)	Firstly, I defined a typed state using TypedDict to enforce input/output structure.
   ii)	Implemented a simple response node that echoes user input.
   iii)	Created a StateGraph with a single node (respond).
   iv)	Following which, setting the entry point and terminated the graph using END.
   v)	Finally, compiled the graph into an executable agent.

 
Testing has been done by:
   i)	Firstly, I imported the agent into testing.py.
   ii)	Invoked the agent with a sample input: result = agent.invoke({"input": "Hello Agent!"})
   iii)	Verified correct structured output in the console.
 
Conclusion
The above steps successfully establish the foundational architecture for the AI Testing Agent project. With a clean environment setup, structured backend, and a working baseline agent, the project is well-prepared for future expansion into advanced AI-driven testing workflows.
